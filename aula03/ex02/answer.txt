    The TC74 operates at 2.7V to 5.5V. The ESP32-C3 operates at 3.3V logic levels. Therefore, it is compatible in terms of
voltage.
    In terms of power consumption, the TC74 typically consumes 10 µA on standby and 350 μA while operating.
ESP32-C3 can provide up to 40mA per GPIO pin therefore it is compatible in terms of current.
