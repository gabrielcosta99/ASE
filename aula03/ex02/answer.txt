    The TC74 operates at 2.7V to 5.5V. The ESP32-C3 operates at 3.3V logic levels. Therefore, it is compatible in terms of
voltage.
    In terms of power consumption, the TC74 typically consumes 10 µA on standby and 350 μA while operating.
We might need an external regulator in order for ESP32-C3 to supply enough power
